# Scrape to Update:

## Description:
"Scrape to Update" is a Python script designed to streamline the process of maintaining accurate and competitive prices for Pok√©mon cards in your Shopify store.  
The script scrapes the latest card prices from specified websites and automatically updates a Shopify-compatible CSV file, ready for upload.  
This ensures your store always reflects current market values, enhancing your inventory management and customer satisfaction.

The script uses Python's library such as Pandas, Regular Expression, requests and BeautifulSoup4 to scrape, search and update the CSV file.  

## Scripts  
__Menu display.py__  
This main script contains an object oriented controller as menu, with each set called upon as a class.  
The script can be used after cloning in any software with Python interpreter.  
There is an option to not use the Shopify CSV file update feature and a simple CSV file will be generated containing ID, Name and Price.  
In order to use the Shopify CSV file update feature, it must be included into the same folder as the script.  

__Pokellector_Namegenerator.py (additional)__  
This additional script scrapes the list of names provided from the website Pokellector.com.  
The script can be used after cloning in any software with Python interpreter.  
The script will generate a CSV file containing ID and Name, and multiples will be created for cards with Reverse Holo option.  
In order to use the script, copy and paste the link directly from the webpage bar and include the last card within the set.  

## Requirements
Any python environment with interpreter can run the script.  

However, certain libraries have to be installed beforehand.  

__BeautifulSoup4__
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

__requests__
```
pip install requests
```

__Regular Expression__
```
pip install regex
```

## Features
The main script has a menu for the user to choose which specific set to update.
The user would have to put the CSV file within the same folder as the script and rename it to the specified naming format.


## Current Issues/Future Roadmap
__1) The website may change its format due to inventory audit, out of stock or minor mistakes.__
  Future updates will include checks or more error exception to ensure the script is still able to run or alternatives are included.
  Current issues encountered:
  Inclusive of Promo cards (Fixed)
  Separate version of card ID in SV3.5 (Fixed for SV3.5)
  Duplicated entries
  Inventory audit
  
__2) The codes for each series is an individual class.__
  Future version can simplify the entire code to a single parent to simplify the code for checking and running.

## Acknowledgements
This script was just a passion project after learning how to do webscraping through Python using BeautifulSoup4.
I would like to thank my mentors for the guidance on using OOP to create a controller and to use BS4.
