# Scrape to Update:

## Description:
"Scrape to Update" is a Python script designed to streamline the process of maintaining accurate and competitive prices for Pok√©mon cards in your Shopify store.  
The script scrapes the latest card prices from specified websites and automatically updates a Shopify-compatible CSV file, ready for upload.  
This ensures your store always reflects current market values, enhancing your inventory management and customer satisfaction.

The script uses Python's library such as Pandas, Regular Expression, requests and BeautifulSoup4 to scrape, search and update the CSV file.  

## Scripts  
__Menu display.py__  
This main script contains an object oriented controller as menu, with each set called upon as a class.  
The script can be used after cloning in any software with Python interpreter.  
There is an option to not use the Shopify CSV file update feature and a simple CSV file will be generated containing ID, Name and Price.  
In order to use the Shopify CSV file update feature, it must be included into the same folder as the script.  

__Pokellector_Namegenerator.py (additional)__  
This additional script scrapes the list of names provided from the website Pokellector.com.  
The script can be used after cloning in any software with Python interpreter.  
The script will generate a CSV file containing ID and Name, and multiples will be created for cards with Reverse Holo option.  
In order to use the script, copy and paste the link directly from the webpage bar and include the last card within the set.  

## Requirements
Any python environment with interpreter can run the script.  

However, certain libraries have to be installed beforehand.  

__BeautifulSoup4__
```
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

__requests__
```
pip install requests
```

__Regular Expression__
```
pip install regex
```

## Features
# Menu
The main script is designed using Object Oriented Programming with a simple menu design.  
  
This is the initial options to choose between English and Japanese sets.

If option 2 was chose, English sets will be list out the options.

As of the current design, you can choose the options by typing the option number on the left when prompted.  
In this scenario, "00" is the option to run all of the listed set consecutively.  
Once you have chosen the sets, another prompt will ask if the CSV file for the chosen set exists.

If the CSV file does not exist, a simple CSV file containing the ID, Name and USD price will be generated as demo instead.  
Once all options are entered, the program will run starting.  


## Current Issues/Future Roadmap
__1) The website may change its format due to inventory audit, out of stock or minor mistakes.__  
  Future updates will include checks or more error exception to ensure the script is still able to run or alternatives are included.  
  Current issues encountered:  
  Inclusive of Promo cards (Fixed in Version 1.4)  
  ![image](https://github.com/pa0005in/sawadeekard_price/assets/142402904/704bc55f-bfcb-43e5-8f60-65e8b2d41e3e)  
  Separate version of card ID in SV3.5 (Fixed for SV3.5 in Version 1.4)

  Duplicated entries from website

  Inventory audit

  Galar Gallery (#GG0x) and Trainer Gallery (#TG0x) cannot be read by the script

__2) The codes for each series is an individual class.__  
  Future version can simplify the entire code to a single parent to simplify the code for checking and running.  

## Acknowledgements  
This script was just a passion project after learning how to do webscraping through Python using BeautifulSoup4.  
I would like to thank my mentors for the guidance on using OOP to create a controller and to use BS4.
